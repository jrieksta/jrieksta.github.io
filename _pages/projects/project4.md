Functional traits are extensively used investigating ecosystem functioning and are a part of many existing ecological theories for tradeoffs. In order to apply and utilize tradeoffs in intraspecific plant functional trait variability in predictive ecology, we need to correctly assess the drivers of variation within species. 

We collected functional traits along large elevational gradients in Rocky Mountains, southwestern Colorado. We used microsatellite analysis to determine genotype and cytotype, and investigated functional traits differed between genotypes and cytotypes.
